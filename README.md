### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. Total revenue
2. Average order value
3. Total pizzas sold
4. Total orders
5. Average pizzas per order

## Execution
1. Connect to MySQL Workbench.
2. Create a database named 'pizza_project'.
3. Load the dataset into the 'pizza_sales' table.
4. Execute the provided SQL queries to extract insights and answer specific questions related to pizza sales.

Feel free to explore the SQL queries and modify them as needed to derive additional insights from the dataset.
